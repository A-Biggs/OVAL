| Traditionally, Cisco discloses information required for an end-user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. This information includes all the required technical information for customers to ascertain appropriate remedial action. OVAL provides a framework that allows vendors and their customer to determine if a software vulnerability or patch exists on a given system. Cisco is in the process of adopting OVAL for vulnerability disclosure. Cisco IOS security vulnerability OVAL content is currently supported. Additional products are being considered in the future.

| SIX OVAL is a free and open-source Java class library to build enterprise compliance/vulnerability management applications. The main parts are OVAL domain model and object-XML/object-RDB data mapping. It also provides off-the-shelf server/client components including a repository of definitions and results at the central server, which can be searched from and posted to via a web service connection from any number of clients. The client is capable of getting definitions from the repository, evaluating the content on the local host, and reporting the results back to the central server.

SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *Declared February 25, 2010*
| *www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Atlantic/*
|
| The SCAP Compliance Checker has adopted OVAL as part of the FDCC Scanner capabilities of SCAP Validation Program. SCAP Compliance Checker is able to process all four of OVAL's schemas: the Definitions schema, the System Characteristics schema, the Results schema and the Variables schema. SCAP Compliance Checker processes the XCCDF content of a SCAP stream and extracts any variables that need to be imported into the OVAL engine. It then creates an XML file using the OVAL Variables schema that contains these variables. The OVAL engine later uses this file during OVAL processing. By using the industry standard OVAL schemas, SCAP Compliance Checker can share data with any tool that understands OVAL.
