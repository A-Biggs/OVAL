Consensus Building
==================

The intent behind consensus in the context of the OVAL Community is the notion of what is known as `rough consensus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus>`_. This does not require all participants to agree, and it's not a voting mechanism. The gist of it is that no serious, unaddressed objections exist. As mentioned in the previously described characteristics, it will be up to the Area Supervisors to judge rough consensus. Then, if there is an objection to a proposal, and that objection has been sufficiently addressed, then we can move forward. Conversely, if there is an objection that has not been sufficiently addressed, we know the process cannot move forward. This notion has worked well in other venues, and we believe it will serve us well here also.

How To
------

Because our process is open to the possibility of accepting proposals that may not enjoy wide interest, it may end up being the case that a proposal achieves rough consensus, even though only two or three parties support it (everyone else may be completely indifferent). In this situation, there are no objections to the proposal, but there's also not necessarily a critical mass of support. In this case, there is no harm in such a minimally supported proposal "making it through" - there are, after all, no objections to the proposal, and we must assume that those interested in that particular area are paying attention enough to otherwise object. In other words, this is why we have the desire to retain and keep interested and active Area Supervisors.

Reaching consensus is really about carrying on a conversation. Because each proposal is submitted as a GitHub issue, such conversation should be conducted via that GitHub issue, so that the entire community sees the conversation as it unfolds, and therefore has an opportunity to opine, should they have an opinion worth stating.

It is the responsibiltiy of all interested parties to achieve consensus. Getting to consensus is not necessarily the Area Supervisor's responsibility, nor is it exclusively the proposer's responsibility. Here are some guidelines that may help in reaching consensus:

- Ensure the proposal is clearly scoped
- List each concern participants have about the proposal
- Use quick, simple polls to quickly guage interest in a solution[#]_
- Understand that lack of disagreement is *more important* than total agreement
- Rough consensus is achieved when all issues are addressed, but not necessarily accommodated
- Rough consensus is *not* about for and against cohorts


FAQs
----

**What are the principles of consensus building?**

* **Inclusion:** Everyone in the community has a voice, and their voice is valued.
* **Participation:** People are participating - consensus is not nearly as effective when only a few (or worse, no one but the proposer) are really involved int he discussion.
* **Cooperation:** Individuals and organizations need to work toward the common goal of finding a solution in the best interest of the community.
* **Egalitarianism:** No one person's voice necessarily carries any more weight than an other's.
* **Solution-mindedness:** Always keep the solution in mind, which helps to avoid any perceived inter-organizational/-personal conflicts

**What are the benefits of using a consensus processs?**

An ideal outcome of a consensus process is that everyone is enthusiastically supportive of a proposal. However, the well-known aphroism states, "perfect is the enemy of the good". The real benefit of a consensus process is that parties with sometimes differing perspectives and needs are satisfied, if not necessarily emhpatically pleased, with a given solution.

**Does consenting to a solution mean it's my first choice?**

Not at all. Consenting to a solution simply means that you agree to the solution being proposed, not that it's your ideal solution. Sometimes this is known as disagree and commit. You may disagree that this is the *best* solution, from your singular perspective, but commit to supporting the solution as the *overall better* solution for the community as a whole.

**Who judges rough consensus?**

As described in our process, the Area Supervisor (from time to time under the guidance of the Leadership Board) will be the judge of rough consensus.

**What about this for and against cohort thing?**

A really good treatment is found in `RFC7282 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7282/>`_ of the IETF. There are two sections in particular that describe situations where there may be vast numbers for or against, but the rough consensus is still against or for respectively. In cases like this, the Area Supervisor's challenge will be to sift through the yeas and the nays to determine which of those voices have been *active throughout the discussion regarding the proposal*.
