Objections
==========

Objections are a mechanism for blocking an open Proposal that conflicts with an :ref:`OVAL Design Principle <oval-design-principles>`.

First Steps
-----------

Before making an Objection:

#. **Collaborate**: You MUST make a good faith attempt to engage with the Proposal Author and wider community by commenting on the Proposal (i.e. the Pull Request) and explaining your concerns. Typically, the community can work together on the Proposal to clarify any misconceptions and revise the Proposal, if necessary, to avoid any negative impact.
#. **Allow Time**: You MUST give the Proposal Author and community some time (at least a few days) to respond to your comments.
#. **Suggest a Better Way**: If possible, you SHOULD make an Alternate Proposal to resolve the Issue and address your concerns.


How To
------

#. Complete the `First Steps`_ above
#. Identify the specific :ref:`oval-design-principles` that the Proposal conflicts with. Or, if the Proposal does not conflict with an existing Design Principle, you may draft and propose a new Design Principle.
#. Create a `New Issue <https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/issues/new>`_ as follows:
  - Title Format: ``Objection: Proposal PR #<pull-request-#>``
  - Area Label: add any ``<Area:area-name>`` labels attached to the PR
  - Type Label: add the ``Type:Objection``
  - Comments:
    - Include each existing :ref:`oval-design-principles`, if any, that the Proposal conflicts with and how it conflicts
    - Include each proposed new Design Principle, if any, along with a general justification for the Design Principle and how it conflicts with the Proposal
    - Include a link to the `First Steps`_ you have taken
#. Add resolution steps here
