# Area Supervisors Meeting: May 10, 2021

## Agenda
- Question on SSHD test: Adding FileBehaviors?
- If we're doing that, why isnt that just a TextFileContent check?
- The intent of the SSHD test was for the running SSHD instance;  If many can be running at the same time, maybe this test is a moot point
- Added Palo Alto: Reviewers?
- Added AIX `lssec`: Reviewers?

## Participants
